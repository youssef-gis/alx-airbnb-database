## Feature Breakdown

This project encompasses the core functionality of a rental marketplace, broken down into the following key features:

*   **User Authentication & Management**
    This feature allows users to securely create an account, log in, and manage their personal profiles. It forms the foundation of the platform by ensuring secure access to personalized features and protecting user data.

*   **Property Listings & Management**
    This enables hosts to create, view, update, and delete property listings with details like descriptions, photos, prices, and availability. It is the core inventory system of the platform, providing the bookable assets for guests.

*   **Search & Discovery**
    Users can browse and filter available properties based on criteria like location, dates, price range, and amenities. This feature drives engagement and bookings by helping guests easily find properties that match their needs.

*   **Booking System**
    This core functionality allows authenticated guests to reserve a property for specific dates, calculates the total cost, and handles availability conflicts. It facilitates the main transaction between the guest and the host.

*   **Reviews & Ratings**
    After a stay, guests can leave public reviews and ratings for a property and its host. This builds trust and community within the platform by providing valuable feedback for future guests and hosts.

*   **Payment Processing**
    This integrated feature securely handles financial transactions, allowing guests to pay for their bookings using credit cards or other payment methods. It ensures a smooth and trustworthy monetary exchange on the platform.



## API Security

Securing our backend APIs is paramount to protecting our users, their data, and the integrity of our platform. We will implement the following key security measures:

### Key Security Measures

*   **Authentication (JWT Tokens):** We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate users. Upon login, a user receives a signed token that must be included in subsequent requests to access protected endpoints, verifying their identity.

*   **Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC):** Beyond authentication, we will implement authorization to control what authenticated users can do. For example, a user can only edit or delete their own property listings, and only an admin user might have access to certain administrative endpoints.

*   **Rate Limiting:** We will implement rate limiting on our APIs to protect against Denial-of-Service (DoS) and brute-force attacks. This restricts the number of requests a client can make to the API within a specific time window, ensuring stability and availability for all users.

*   **Data Sanitization & Validation:** All user input will be rigorously validated and sanitized on the backend to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Django's built-in form and model validation provide a strong foundation for this.

*   **HTTPS Encryption:** All data in transit between the client and our server will be encrypted using HTTPS. This ensures that sensitive information, like login credentials and payment details, cannot be intercepted and read by malicious actors.

### Why Security is Crucial

*   **Protecting User Data:** Implementing strong authentication and authorization is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), protecting our users' privacy and complying with regulations like GDPR.

*   **Securing Payments:** The payment processing feature handles highly sensitive financial data. HTTPS encryption and secure backend practices are non-negotiable to prevent data breaches and maintain trust with our users.

*   **Maintaining Platform Integrity:** Rate limiting and input validation protect the platform from being overwhelmed or manipulated by malicious attacks, ensuring it remains stable and reliable for legitimate users.

*   **Preventing Unauthorized Actions:** Proper authorization ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to do (e.g., a user cannot cancel another user's booking), which is fundamental to the platform's correct and fair operation.


## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a modern software development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes and deploying applications. **Continuous Integration (CI)** automatically builds and tests every change pushed to the main code repository. **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automatically deploys every change that passes the CI tests to a staging or production environment.

### Importance for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for maintaining code quality, accelerating development velocity, and ensuring reliable deployments. It automatically catches bugs and integration issues early through automated testing, provides a consistent and repeatable process for releasing updates, and allows the team to deliver new features to users quickly and safely.

### Tools for Our Pipeline

*   **GitHub Actions:** To define and execute our CI/CD workflows directly from our GitHub repository. It will handle running tests, building containers, and triggering deployments on every code push or pull request.
*   **Docker:** To containerize the application, ensuring that it runs consistently across all environments (development, testing, production).
*   **Docker Hub / Amazon ECR:** A registry to store our built Docker images, making them available for deployment.
*   **AWS ECS / Kubernetes:** Orchestration services to deploy and manage our containerized application in the cloud.
*   **SonarCloud / CodeCov:** Optional tools for automated code quality analysis and test coverage reporting, integrated into the CI process.
